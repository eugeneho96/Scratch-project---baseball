# Scratch-project---baseball
this project was created on scratch to simulate a baseball game.
the player can use spacebar to swing the bat.
after awhile, the ball will be pitched toward the player.
the goal is to hit the ball with the bat, up to 5 batters, without incurring 3 strikes at any time.
at any time in which 3 strikes are achieved, the game is over.
once the player manages to hit the ball 5 times (5 batters), the player has won the game.
